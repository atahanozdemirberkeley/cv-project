            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
              Sergei Mikhailovich Prokudin-Gorskii (1863â€“1944) was a visionary
              color photographer in the early 20th century. In 1907, he secured
              permission from the Tzar to document the Russian Empire in color,
              using a groundbreaking method of recording three exposures on
              glass plates with red, green, and blue filters. His collection
              includes the only color portrait of Leo Tolstoy, along with
              thousands of images of people, landscapes, and architecture.
              Although his dream of projecting these images in classrooms across
              Russia never materialized, his glass plate negatives survived and
              were later preserved by the Library of Congress, offering a rare
              glimpse of pre-revolutionary Russia.
            </p>
            <p>
              In this project, I aim to colorize the Prokudin-Gorskii collection
              by aligning the three individual glass plate negatives (red,
              green, and blue) to reconstruct and produce vibrant, colored
              images from the early 20th century with as few visual artifacts as
              possible.
            </p>

              collection can be seen on the right and the final aligned and
              produced image can be seen below.

        <h2>Approach</h2>
        <h3>Initial Approach</h3>
        <p>
          The most straightforward approach to align the color channels is by
          keeping a reference channel (I chose blue) and exhaustively searching
          over a [15, 15] pixel window for optimal translations of the target
          channels (green and red). This method requires a metric to compute
          similarity between the reference and target channels. I experimented
          with Sum of Squared Differences (SSD), Normalized Cross Correlation
          (NCC), and Normalized Mutual Information (NMI). Among these, NMI
          performed best in my tests (as can be seen below), likely due to its robustness in handling
          varying intensity distributions across channels. Thus, I chose NMI.

            </figure>
        </div>
        </p>
        <p> 
            To counteract the border artifacts, I cropped 10% from all sides of the final image. I also tried cropping before aligning but cropping after produced better results.
        </p>
        <p>
            This brute-force strategy works well for smaller
            images but becomes inefficient for larger ones where the optimal
            alignment might fall outside the search window. Increasing the window
            size would lead to prohibitively long processing times. Thus, we need a more efficient strategy for larger .tif images, but here are the results for smaller images from the same collection with their optimal alignments (G, R):

                </figure>
            </div>
        </p>
        <h3>Pyramid Approach</h3>
        <p>
          For larger images, we could do a pyramid-based approach to efficiently handle larger displacements. This method starts by downscaling the image by powers of 2 until its smallest dimension is around 200 pixels. The alignment process begins at the coarsest level, using a larger search window of [-50, 50] pixels to accommodate potentially significant misalignments. As we progress to finer levels, the algorithm refines the alignment using a smaller [-2, 2] pixel window around the previously computed shift.
        </p>
        <p>
          This coarse-to-fine strategy significantly reduces computation time while maintaining accuracy. It allows for efficient handling of large displacements that would be computationally prohibitive with the brute-force method. As with the initial approach, I used Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) as the similarity metric due to its robust performance across varying channel intensities.
        </p>
        <p>
          To enhance the alignment quality for these high-resolution images, I implemented additional preprocessing steps. The input image is converted to float32 and normalized to the [0, 1] range before alignment. After alignment, I crop 15% from all sides to remove potential border artifacts. Here are some results from larger .tif images in the collection, showing the effectiveness of this approach:

        </div>
        <p>
          The pyramid approach successfully aligned these large images, handling significant displacements that would have been missed by the initial approach's smaller search window. The results demonstrate the method's ability to produce vibrant, well-aligned color images from Prokudin-Gorskii's glass plate negatives, even for high-resolution scans with large misalignments.
